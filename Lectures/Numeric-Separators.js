// NUMERIC SEPARATORS:
/*
-> NUMERIC SEPARATORS ARE VERY USEFUL FOR CLEAN CODE.
-> IT IS PUTTING UNDERSCORE_ IN THE MIDDLE OR AFTER NEXT NUMBER VALUE.

-> IT HELP US FOR READABLE CODE , IF WE HAVE A BIG NUMBER VALUE , THEN WE CAN USE THE NUMERIC SEPARATOR .

-> THE JAVASCRIPT ENGINE WILL IGNORE THESE UNDERSCORES AUTOMATICALLY.
-> IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE START ALSO IN THE END OF A VALUE.

-> IT ALSO DOESN'T WORK AFTER . POINT OR BEFORE IT , IT IS NOT ALLOWED IN JAVASCRIPT.

-> IT DOESN'T WORK IN A STRING VALUE IF WE HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO NUMBER.

-> THE PARSE WILL ONLY GET THE FIRST NUMBER VALUES FROM THAT.
